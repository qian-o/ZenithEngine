## Code Standard
- Prefer using `(static item => item.Property)` Lambda expressions.
- Prefer using new() syntax sugar.
- Prefer using pattern matching. Such as `is, is not, =>`.
- If a class is `internal` and has value type parameters that need to be accessed externally, allow `public Type FieldName`.
- Class members should be in the following order: Fields, Constructors, Properties, Methods.
- Modifiers: public > internal > protected > private, non-static > static.
- The remaining modifiers are sorted by function or business logic.

## Regular Expression Format
- `,+[\s]+[^\S\r\n]+};` Search for the comma after the last property when simplifying property assignments.
